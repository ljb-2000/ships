StarCitizen Organization Ship Tracker

This is a ship tracker for the game Star Citizen in which an organization can
allow its player base to update at their leisure what ships they have and what
hey intend to name it.

I wanted to learn to use Flask and this is my first web app for practice. Any
suggestions for features and criticim regarding code would be greatly appreciated.
